# Depression-Checker

A hardware product made through STM32 and Circuitry components checking user's depression by monitoring user's sleep and movement behavior. The project is made by STM21F401RE. Once the user is inactive for an extensive period of time calculated based on statistical 
analysis of their past sleeping movement, the system will buzz. This is also used for my ECE 198 project, where I would need to develop a product addressing health concerns using STM32 Board.

## Materials:

- PIR Motion Sensor: This component operates in the milliwatt range, with no significant energy storage.

- Breadboard

- 2 Red LED Light

- LCD Controller (HD47780): Used to display the central message

- A big box

## Installation Guide:

An image of the physical structure and the circuitry diagram is listed in this github. Please reference the two documents to install the product.

Please implement the following configuration on breadboard:

- GPIO_PIN_8 =>

- GPIO_PIN_6 =>

- GPIO_PIN_9 =>
